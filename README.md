# 📰 NotiLytics
*A reactive news analytics web application built with the Play Framework (Java)*

---

## 📘 Overview
**NotiLytics** is developed as part of the **SOEN 6441 – Software Project Management (Fall 2025)** course at **Concordia University**.  
It demonstrates Java 8 functional programming, asynchronous web development with **Play Framework**, and reactive data analysis using **Streams** and **Futures**.

The goal is to build a system that retrieves and analyzes live news feeds from the **[News API](https://newsapi.org)**.  
The app allows users to:
- Search for recent articles by keyword or phrase
- View the 10 most recent results (title, source, and publication date)
- Extend functionality with additional analytics such as:
    - 🔤 Word frequency statistics
    - 😊 Sentiment classification (happy / sad / neutral)
    - 📚 Readability scoring (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level & Flesch Reading Score)
    - 🌐 Source profile pages

### 🧮 Description Readability Feature
For every search query, NotiLytics calculates and displays:
- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Indicates the U.S. school grade required to understand the article's description (lower is easier).
- **Flesch Reading Score**: Ranges from 0–100+; higher scores mean easier reading.
- **Average scores**: For all articles in each search, the average grade level and reading score are shown at the top of the results.

These scores are computed using Java 8 Streams and are visible for each article and as an average for each search query.
